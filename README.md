Sudoku solver using backtracking in python

"Welcome to my Sudoku Solver project! This Python-based program is designed to tackle the classic puzzle of Sudoku, using a powerful technique called backtracking. Sudoku is a number puzzle that challenges your logical thinking and problem-solving skills. With this solver, you can input an unsolved Sudoku grid, and the program will intelligently find the solution. It employs a recursive backtracking algorithm that explores possible numbers for each empty cell, undoing and trying a different approach if a conflict is encountered. Whether you're new to Sudoku or a seasoned player, this tool is a handy way to sharpen your skills and enjoy the satisfaction of solving even the most challenging Sudoku puzzles."
